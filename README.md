# Tyrant

_"Freedom choked in dread we live, since tyrant was enthroned."_

Tyrant implements all common steps of authorization workflows using overridable _operations_. It allows a quick setup of sign in, sign up, forgot password, etc. Tryrant works well in Rails, but plays well with any Ruby environment.

Operations are provided for the following steps.

* SignIn
  * Confirmed
  * Hammer protection (3x wrong blabla)
  * Sticky (Remember me)
* SignUp
* SignOut
* ResetPassword
* Forgot pw
* Mutiple sessions with scopes


## Operations

Tyrant exposes its public API using operations.

Operations are the pivotal element in the [Trailblazer architecture](https://github.com/apotonick/trailblazer). When it comes to customization, Tyrant doesn't rely on a "hopefully complete" configuration language as Devise does it.

Tyrant allows you to customize with Ruby. You can override entire workflow steps (operations), forms and validations (contracts) or methods using simple object-orientation and a clean API.


This means you can easily use them in Rails controllers.

```ruby
class SessionController < ApplicationController
  def sign_in
    run Tyrant::SignIn
  end
```

You can also run the public API in any other Ruby environment, e.g. a console or a Roda action.

```ruby
Tyrant::SignIn.run(params)
```

Tyrant provides forms for all workflow steps. using [Reform](https://github.com/apotonick/reform) objects that are embedded into the operations.


=> Customize with inheritance, or override. Or just don't use the operation and write your own "step".
